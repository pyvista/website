  The PyVista project is a collection of Free Licensed Open Source Software (FLOSS) around 3D visualization and mesh analysis in Python. The flagship PyVista library provides the core 3D plotting and mesh types used across the PyVista project.

  At its core, PyVista is a pure Python library - However, its dependencies, namely the Visualization Toolkit (VTK) is in C++. By wrapping the VTK library's Python bindings into the PyVista suite, we have created a streamlined and intuitive toolset for 3D Visualization and mesh analysis/processing. Since PyVista is purely Python and VTK has wheels deployed for most major platforms and Python versions, PyVista can be used across platforms - it is being used across UNIX and Windows platforms everyday!

  PyVista is built on top of the Visualization Toolkit (VTK) directly inheriting VTK mesh types and wrapping a layer of functionality on top of those types to make creation and analysis of those data structures simple and intuitive. This all means that PyVista is immediately interoperable with any VTK-based software - which is a part of our mission to break down the barrier to entry for 3D visualization across the sciences.
